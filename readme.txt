## 1. Create and Manage Taxonomies ##

TaxoPress can manage all the taxonomies created by WordPress and your plugins and themes. You can change the settings for each taxonomy. For example, you can change the visual labels, and control whether the taxonomy is organized in parent-child relationships. You can also assign your taxonomies to different post types. For example, you can use TaxoPress to add Categories to Pages, or WooCommerce Tags to Posts.

## 2. Terms Display ##

The Terms Display feature in TaxoPress allows you to show a cloud or list of the terms used on your site. For example, you can create a "Tag Cloud" showing all your WooCommerce product categories, or you can create a list of all the tags on bbPress topics.

TaxoPress makes it easy to customize the format of your terms, and add custom CSS styles. The terms can be shown in a shortcode, a widget, or TaxoPress can try and automatically add the terms into your content.

[Click here to read about Terms Display](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-tag-clouds/).

## 3. Terms for Current Post ##

The Terms for Current Post feature in TaxoPress allows you to customize the displays of terms for single posts. This display is separate from any default display of terms in your theme, so you can use this feature to easily show terms anywhere on your site.

TaxoPress makes it easy to customize the format of your terms, and add custom CSS styles. The terms can be shown in a shortcode, a widget, or TaxoPress can try and automatically add the terms into your content.

[Click here to read about Terms for Current Post](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-tags-for-current-post/).

## 4. Related Posts ##

TaxoPress can display posts that are related to the current post. This feature works by checking for shared taxonomy terms. If your post has the terms “Vegetables” and “Food”, then this feature will likely display other posts that also have the terms “Vegetables” and “Food”. The more terms that are shared, the more likely a post is to show.

The Related Posts can be shown in a shortcode, a widget, or TaxoPress can try and automatically add the related posts into your content.

[Click here to read about Related Posts](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-related-posts/).

## 5. Auto Links ##

The Auto Links feature in TaxoPress will automatically add links to your content. If you have a term called “WordPress”, the Auto Links feature will find any instances of “WordPress” in your content and add a link to the archive page for that tag. So any instances of “WordPress” will link to /tag/wordpress.

[Click here to read about Auto Links](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-auto-links/).

## 6. Auto Terms ##

This feature allows WordPress to examine your post content and title for specified terms and automatically add those terms as Tags. Here’s an example of how it works:

* You add “WordPress” to the keywords list in TaxoPress.
* If your post content or title contains the word “WordPress”, then TaxoPress will automatically add “WordPress” as a term for this post.

[Click here to read about automatically adding terms](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-auto-terms/).

## 7. Suggest Terms ##

The Suggest Terms feature helps when you're writing content in WordPress. It becomes much easier for you to find the best taxonomy terms for your content.

Suggest Terms can show two metaboxes on your post editing screen:

* One metabox can help you browse and select from all your existing terms. 
* One metabox can analyze your content and find new ideas for terms. TaxoPress can suggest terms that already exist on your site. TaxoPress can also create new ideas from services such as Dandelion and Open Calais.

[Click here to read about suggesting terms](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-suggested-tags/).

## 8. Mass Edit Terms ##

The Mass Edit Terms screen allows you to quickly add or remove taxonomy terms from any content in WordPress.

The first step is to choose which taxonomy you want to modify. At the top of the screen, use the dropdown boxes to choose your taxonomy. You will now see all your Posts and the Tags attached to them. You can now add or remove terms to all your posts.

[Click here to read about suggesting terms](https://taxopress.com/docs/mass-edit-terms/).

## 9. Manage Terms ##

The Manage Terms screen in TaxoPress provides you with several useful tools to manage the terms on your site. These tools can be used with any taxonomy. Here are some of the tools on the Manage Terms screen:

* **Add terms**: Quickly add terms to your content.
* **Rename terms**: Change the name of your terms in bulk.
* **Merge terms**: Combine existing terms together. This is very useful for fixing typos in your terms.
* **Remove terms**: Remove terms from all posts, without deleting those terms.
* **Delete terms**: Delete terms in bulk.
* **Delete unused terms**: Delete any terms that are rarely used.

== Installation ==

**Requires PHP 5.6 or ideally PHP 7.**

TaxoPress can be installed in 3 easy steps:

1. Unzip the TaxoPress archive and put all files into a folder like "/wp-content/plugins/simple-tags/"
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Inside the WordPress admin, go to the 'TaxoPress' mennu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Add Categories and Tags to WordPress Pages? =

Yes, you can. Both Categories and Tags are “taxonomies” and they can help you sort your content. However, on a normal WordPress site, both Categories and Tags are only available for Posts. This means that you do not have any options to organize your Pages … unless you use a plugin such as TaxoPress. I’ll show you how to add Categories to your WordPress Pages.

* Install the TaxoPress plugin.
* Go to “TaxoPress” and then “Taxonomies” in your WordPress admin area.
* Click “Edit” under “Categories”.
* Click the “Post Types” tab.
* Check the box for “Pages”.
* You may also want to check the box “Show content from all post types on archive page” so that your Posts and Pages are grouped together on the Category pages.
* You will now see that “Categories” are available under “Pages” in your WordPress admin menu.
* When you are editing a Page, you will see the “Categories” box in the right sidebar.
* You will also be able to add and remove Categories using the “Quick Edit” and “Bulk Edit” features.

[Click here to see how to Add Categories and Tags to WordPress Pages](https://taxopress.com/add-categories-wordpress-pages/).

= How Many Levels of Sub-Categories Does WordPress Support? =

There is no technical limit to how deep your nested categories can go. In an image you can see by clicking the link below, I’ve created 10 levels of categories. You can keep adding sub-category levels as deep as you wish. 

The main limitation to consider will be the WordPress admin area which will start to look strained. In another you can see by clicking, I’ve added twenty levels. When I go to add “Level 21”, the “Parent Category” dropdown appears to be broken. Those extra levels appear on the main “Categories” screen, but each one is only displayed after a long row of hyphens. And when you try to add a category to a post, you may find that the lower levels are not easily visible inside the metabox. The reason that WordPress allows you to have an unlimited number of sub-categories is that these are simple database entries. The sub-categories are controlled by the parent column in the wp_term_taxonomy table. Adding more sub-categories will not slow your site down at all.

Finally, I’ll note that you can add multiple levels to any WordPress taxonomy. Go to the “Taxonomies” screen in TaxoPress. When you click “Edit”, you’ll be able to change the settings for each taxonomy. You can control whether the taxonomy is organized in parent-child relationships.

[Click here to see about category levels in WordPress](https://taxopress.com/how-many-levels-sub-categories/).

= How Do I Create WordPress Taxonomies for Internal Use? =

We often have TaxoPress users who want to organize their content privately. They want a taxonomy that is only used and seen in the WordPress admin area. With the TaxoPress plugin, you can create taxonomies for internal use only. Your content will still be visible, but it can be organized with hidden taxonomies.

* Install the TaxoPress plugin.
* Go to “Taxonomies” in the WordPress admin area.
* Create a new taxonomy.

That’s it! The easy approach is to use TaxoPress to create a new taxonomy. If you never decide to actively display the taxonomy, it will never be shown anywhere. It will only be available in the WordPress admin area. You will be able to add terms to this taxonomy while adding content.

Inside the “Taxonomies” screen, you can click the “Admin Area” tab and choose where your private taxonomy appears:

* Show user interface: Should be the visible screen to manage these terms?
* Show in admin menus: Should there be a link to this taxonomy in the WordPress admin menu?
* Show in frontend menus: Should this taxonomy be available for the “Menus” screen.
* Show admin menu: Should this taxonomy appear on screens such as “Posts” and “Pages”?
* Show in “Quick Edit” and “Bulk Edit”: Should this taxonomy be available in editing tools on screens such as “Posts” and “Pages”?

= How Do I Display Taxonomy Terms in a Widget? =

It is possible to use TaxoPress to show terms in a WordPress widget. Go to Appearance > Widget and look for the “Term Display (TaxoPress Shortcode)” widget. This can be placed into any area that your theme has available.

[Click here to see more about showing terms in a widget](https://taxopress.com/docs/tag-cloud-widget/).

= How Do I Display Taxonomy Terms with a Shortcode? =

TaxoPress allows you to show a cloud or list of the terms in a taxonomy. You can show your terms using the shortcode shown on the “Terms Display” screen. If you are using the block editor in WordPress, you can add shortcodes using the “Shortcode” block.

[Click here to see more about showing terms with a shortcode](https://taxopress.com/docs/tag-cloud-shortcode/).

= How Do I Automatically Add Tags in WordPress? =

If you have a busy WordPress site, it can be difficult to organize all your content. Fortunately, with TaxoPress, there is a way to automatically add Tags to posts. You can create the Tags and then allow TaxoPress to add them to relevant posts. The “Auto Terms” feature in TaxoPress can scan your WordPress posts and automatically assign Tags. For example, imagine you have a term called “Apples”. Auto Terms can analyze your posts and when it finds the word “Apples”, it can add that Tag to your post.

* Go to TaxoPress > Auto Terms in your WordPress admin menu.
* Choose the taxonomy you want to use with Auto Terms. In this example, choose “Tags”.
* Choose the post types you want to use with this feature. In this example, choose “Posts”.
* The other required setting is in “Terms to Use”. You need to choose whether to use all the terms in your “Tags” taxonomy, or only a select group. If you choose to use all the terms, test carefully as this process may slow your site if you have 10,000’s of terms, or if you have a slow server.
* Click “Save Auto Terms”.
* You are now ready to automatically add terms! One approach is to use the “Existing content” option to retroactively add Tags to your content. For new content, TaxoPress can automatically scanned the post text and added the correct Tags.

= How Do I Automatically Add WooCommerce Product Tags and Categories? =

If you have a busy WooCommerce site, it can be difficult to organize all your products. Fortunately, with TaxoPress, there is a way to automatically add Product Tags and Categories. The “Auto Terms” feature in TaxoPress can scan your WooCommerce products and automatically assign WooCommerce Tags and WooCommerce Category. For example, imagine you have a term called “WordPress”. Auto Terms can analyze your WooCommerce products and when it finds the word “WordPress”, it can add that term to your post.

* Go to TaxoPress > Auto Terms in your WordPress admin menu.
* Choose the taxonomy you want to use with Auto Terms. In this example, choose “Product Tags”.
* Choose the post types you want to use with this feature. In this example, choose “Products”.
* The other required setting is in “Terms to Use”. You need to choose whether to use all the terms in your “Product Tags” taxonomy, or only a select group. If you choose to use all the terms, test carefully as this process may slow your site if you have 10,000’s of terms, or if you have a slow server.
* You are now ready to automatically add terms! One approach is to use the “Existing content” option to retroactively add Product Tags to your WooCommerce products. For new content, TaxoPress can automatically scanned the product text and added the correct WooCommerce Tag or WooCommerce Category.
